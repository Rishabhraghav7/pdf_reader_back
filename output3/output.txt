It is yet unknown what causes cardiovascular disease (CVD), but we do know that 
it is associated with a high risk of death, as well as severe morbidity and disability. 
There is an urgent need for AI-based technologies that are able to promptly 
and reliably predict the future outcomes of individuals who have cardiovascular 
disease. The Internet of Things (IoT) is serving as a driving force behind the 
development of CVD prediction. In order to analyse and make predictions based 
on the data that IoT devices receive, machine learning (ML) is used. Traditional 
machine learning algorithms are unable to take differences in the data into 
account and have a low level of accuracy in their model predictions. This research 
presents a collection of machine learning models that can be used to address 
this problem. These models take into account the data observation mechanisms 
and training procedures of a number of different algorithms. In order to verify the 
efficacy of our strategy, we combined the Heart Dataset with other classification 
models. The proposed method provides nearly 96 percent of accuracy result than 
other existing methods and the complete analysis over several metrics has been 
analysed and provided. Research in the field of deep learning will benefit from 
additional data from a large number of medical institutions, which may be used 
for the development of artificial neural network structures.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death 
globally, has become a significant problem in public health all over the 
world. As a result, patients, their families, and the governments of 
these countries have incurred substantial socioeconomic expenses. 
Patients at high risk for CVD can be identified by prediction models 
that use risk stratification. After that, measures that are tailored to this 
group, such as dietary changes and the use of statins, can help reduce 
that risk and contribute to the primary prevention of CVD (1).
Several guidelines for the evaluation and management of CVD 
have suggested using predictive models as a means of identifying 
patients at high risk and assisting with clinical decision-making. The 
Pooled Cohort Equations and the Framingham CV risk equation6, for 
example, have both been subjected to independent evaluations in a 
variety of populations; however, the findings indicated that both of 
these equations were only weakly discriminating and had a poor level 
of calibration (2).
As a direct consequence of this, the predictive power of the 
majority of the models that are now in use is restricted, and there is 
room for advancement. For instance, the assumption of linearity is 
necessary for logistic regression, while the assumption of predictor 
independence is necessary for the Cox proportional hazard model (3).
In the area of study pertaining to the cardiovascular system, 
machine learning (ML) algorithms have been demonstrated to 
be extremely helpful predictors. They are more adept than standard 
statistical models at capturing the complex interactions and nonlinear 
linkages that exist between the variables and the results (4). Several 
different investigations (5–15) came to the conclusion that random 
forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) performed better 
than traditional models.
Cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), 
atrial fibrillation (AF), and other cardiac or vascular ailments continue 
to be the leading cause of death in the world (10). As people living 
standards improve and their stress levels continue to rise, the number 
of people who suffer from CVD is growing at an alarming rate.
According to the most recent estimations (16, 17), CVD will 
be responsible for the deaths of about 23 million people by the year 
2030. Infarction of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, and heart 
failure are all instances of different types of CVD (18, 19). The 
incidence of cardiovascular disease can be influenced by a number of 
factors, including racial or ethnic background, age, gender, body mass 
index (BMI), height, and length of torso, as well as the outcomes of 
blood tests that evaluate factors such as renal function, liver function, 
and cholesterol levels (20, 21) which is shown in Figure 1.
The development of a wide variety of health problems can 
be influenced by the complex interactions that take place between 
these factors. Standard statistical approaches are incapable of 
accounting for all of the intricate causal links that exist between risk 
factors because there are so many of them (22, 23). In this day and age 
of big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been shown to be of 
critical importance. It has made it possible for patients to use smart 
drugs and smart bracelets to monitor and collect accurate data during 
a pandemic (24).
Researchers are employing artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort 
to mine new medical information that can be used by clinicians to 
better understand the symptoms of various diseases and, as a result, 
make more informed decisions for patients (25). This comes as the 
prevalence of data from the internet of things (IoT) grows within 
healthcare systems. In order to investigate previously unknown risk 
factors, current efforts to standardise medical data, and efforts to 
organise national health screening data (26–28), we  will first 
standardise medical data. These risk variables may have a correlation 
with the occurrence of the disease, which means that they could offer 
insights into the mechanisms underlying the disease. Furthermore, 
accurate disease incidence prediction models necessitate the analysis 
of large amounts of data (29, 30). The use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
and massive amounts of data in the prediction of CVD models is 
becoming increasingly common.
The main contribution and novelty of this research is 
mentioned below:
	
•	 To extract a total of 11 distinct characteristics from the dataset.
	
•	 After that, we started by normalising the data and then proceeded 
to divide the Heart dataset into training and testing sets using an 
8:2 split.
	
•	 Afterwards, the incorporated GBDT is utilised in the SHAP 
method for the purpose of selecting features.
	
•	 It helps to construct a stacking model consisting of a base learner 
layer in addition to a meta learner layer.
	
•	 Finally, we will achieve the results over several performance 
metrics analyses and method in the stacking model.
2. Background
Weng et al. (31) tested four different models using clinical data 
from over 300,000 homes in the United Kingdom. According to the 
findings, NN was the method that produced the most accurate CVD 
prediction results for the larger amount of data that were analysed.
The three traditional machine learning models that were tested 
and evaluated by Dimopoulos et al. (32) based on ATTICA data with 
2020 samples for the little CVD dataset were K-Nearest Neighbour 
(KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree. When compared, RF 
was shown to have produced the best results by using the 
HellenicSCORE tool, which is a calibration of the ESC Score.
In view of the growing popularity of machine learning techniques 
in IoT applications, Mohan et al. (15) have proposed a hybrid HRFLM 
strategy as a means of further improving the accuracy of the model 
predictions in light of the aforementioned popularity of machine 
learning methods.
An IoT-ML method was investigated by Akash et al. (33) with the 
goal of predicting the condition of the cardiovascular system in the 
human body. The algorithm model uses machine learning (ML) 
techniques to compute and predict the patient cardiovascular health 
after it has obtained essential data from the human body. This data 
include the patient heart rate, ECG signal, and cholesterol.
Within the framework of Yang et al. (34) examination of local 
locations with separate prediction models, LR was utilised to evaluate 
30 cardiovascular disease-related characteristics utilising more than 
200,000 high-risk participants in eastern China. The results of the 
experiments led to the development of an RF model that is more 
suited to eastern China.

For the first time in the study of CVDs, the idea of a stacking 
model was presented for the very first time by Yang et al. (35). The data 
on air pollution and weather were considered in order to have a better 
understanding of how the stacking model influences the daily 
hospitalisation rate for CVDs. In order to assist in the construction of 
the stacking model, a grassroots level of five basic learners was 
first constructed.
During this period, digital, fully automated ecosystems as well as 
cyber-physical systems are fast growing and finding applications all 
over the world. The creation of smart healthcare, which offers tools 
and processes for early diagnosis of life-threatening disorders, is one 
example of the innovative concepts and technical compositions that 
are being implemented in nearly every business. As the fourth 
industrial revolution moves towards a society that is more 
technologically advanced, there is an urgent requirement for 
additional research into CVD Zheng et al. (36).
3. Proposed method
The first thing that needs to be done is to combine the data from 
the Heart Dataset, which already contains information from 
Cleveland, Hungarian, and Swizerlang, as well as data from Long 
Beach VA and Stalog (Heart). From the five sources, we extracted a 
total of 11 distinct characteristics. After that, we started by normalising 
the data and then proceeded to divide the Heart dataset into training 
and testing sets using an 8:2 split. Afterwards, the incorporated GBDT 
is utilised in the SHAP method for the purpose of selecting features.
In the following stage, we  will construct a stacking model 
consisting of a base learner layer in addition to a meta learner layer. 
The study uses RF, LR, MLP, ET, and CatBoost classifiers to serve as 
our base learners. LR is utilised in the role of the meta learner. Finally, 
the suggested stacking model is assessed with regard to its accuracy, 
precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). In order 
to evaluate the model adaptability to new contexts, we made use of a 
publicly available dataset known as the Heart Attack Dataset.
The Cleveland, Hungarian, Swizerlang, Long Beach VA, and 
Stalog (Heart) datasets, together with others from the machine 
learning repository at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), were 
combined to form the Heart Dataset. We began with a total of 1,190 
samples, and after deleting 272 duplicates, we were left with 918 
unique sample datasets. We started with 1,190 samples. The whole 
Heart dataset is displayed in Table 1, and it consists of 11 features that 
were taken from five different datasets that contained significant 
relevant features.
3.1. Feature select and analysis
It is feasible to increase model performance and save a 
considerable amount of runtime by selecting the ideal subset of 
features that have a significant impact on the prediction outcomes. 
This process is referred to as feature selection, and it is possible to 
accomplish both of these goals.
The three most common methods for picking characteristics are 
called filters, wrappers, and embedding. The research we conducted 
utilised the embedded approach known as GBDT as a means of 
selecting feature variables. This was due to the fact that embedded 
techniques offer superior prediction performance compared to filter 
methods and are noticeably quicker than wrapper methods.
GBDT makes use of an additive model and a forward stepwise 
algorithm in order to achieve learning. These two components work 
together to accomplish this. For non-leaf nodes, the significance of the 
features increases proportionately with the magnitude of the reduction 
in weighted impurity that occurs during splitting.
Because of this, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation 
of the role that each attribute plays in determining the overall accuracy 
of the predictions made by the integrated GBDT. In order to find a 
solution to this issue, we make use of a technique known as feature 
imputation, in which the explanatory model is a linear function of the 
values produced by feature imputation.

where N—features; ∅i—feature attribute value, and Z′i—feature

The Φi value of Equation (1) can be determined by employing a 
tree-valued estimate methodology (also known as the SHAP method), 
which is founded on the concepts of game theory and used as the 
feature attribute values. Below is a formulation for a model f and a set 
S of non-zero Z′ indices, as well as the conventional spherically valued 
attribute ∅i for each feature.

where M—input feature set.
It is essential to keep in mind that the SHAP strategy is 
adapted to the specific context and tailored to individual needs. 
In contrast to the tree model gain, this method can produce 
consistent results for global feature attributes. This is an 
advantage over the tree model gain. In the course of our study, 
we make use of the SHAP methodology in order to isolate and 
assess several individual characteristics.
In addition to this, we investigate the ways in which various 
characteristics interact with one another in order to improve our 
ability to predict outcomes. We differentiate between the contributions 
of individual features and the contributions of feature interactions by 
referring to the former as individual feature contribution and the latter 
as joint feature contribution Φi,j. In the same way as the value, the 
Shapeley interaction index is calculated using a formula, and the joint 
feature contribution i and j can be found by doing the calculation 
as follows.

where Z represents the indices. i,j represent the feature

Equations (3) and (4) in the GBDT model quantify the twinning 
relationships between joint features. So, when judging the model, 
you can get a good idea of how the different factors that interact with 
each other contribute together.
3.2. Model building
To the extent that the model predictions are accurate, each 
individual in the base population has a stronger capacity for learning, 
and the degree of correlation between them decreases. When the 
individual learners are already more accurate, a fusion of models will 
be more successful if the individual learners come from a diverse 
range of backgrounds. This is the foundation upon which the concept 
of error-ambiguity decomposition is built.
This suggests that when picking the foundation learners for our 
organisation, we  should take into account the performance of 
individual learners while also taking into account the distinctiveness 
of each individual learner. Theoretically, it is conceivable to build 
layers of the stacking model indefinitely as long as their fundamental 
classifier is operational. This, of course, results in an increase in the 
level of complexity represented by the model.
To ensure accuracy while reducing the level of complexity 
exhibited by the model, we solely employ the stacking model, which 
is comprised of a two-tiered structure consisting of base learners and 
meta-learners. As a direct consequence of this, SVM, KNN, LR, and 
ET were decided upon as the possible models for base learners to 
utilise in the prediction of CVDs. XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and 
MLP were some of the other options that were thought about. 
Following the selection of the most reliable models as the foundation 
for our education, we restricted the pool of potential candidates to five 
people who exemplified a comprehensive representation of the 
population as a whole. The optuna framework was used in order to get 
the optimal values for the model parameters.
After running a 5-fold CV, this model may generate a large 
number of features. 5-fold CV is a technique that is frequently utilised 
in the first layer of a stacking framework to collect input features for 
the second layer. This paper employs linear regression (LR) as the

classifier for the fusion model predictions since generalised linear 
regression, also known as GLR, has historically been employed in the 
second layer of the stacking architecture. Because adjusting the 
complexity of the output layer of a neural network does not require 
the employment of more complex functions, this example makes use 
of functions that are simpler in nature.
The primary learners are the LR, RF, DT, MLP, and CatBoost 
protocols. At the beginning, we give the training sets eight times as 
many points as the testing sets. Within the training package that 
we provide for each of the five foundational learners, we utilise a 
5-fold CV. A single base learner is capable of producing five 
predictions, and each of these five predictions is arranged in a vertical 
column within a one-dimensional matrix. It possible that the second 
stage of training will be based on a five-dimensional matrix that been 
developed using the data of five different learners as its foundation.
When applied to the testing set, the 5-fold CV model is utilised 
once more to make predictions about our initial testing set, which 
results in the production of five predictions once more. The base 
learners can be  concatenated into a matrix for the stage second 
iteration. We use LR on the meta-learner so that it does not become 
too good at its job. In the second step of the process, we use these 
predictions to build the final results.
4. Results and discussion
The outcomes of the experiments will be discussed here in order 
to illustrate the benefits of the stacking paradigm that was 
recommended by us. Python version 3.9.7 was used throughout each 
and every test. In this investigation, the sklearn 1.0.2 toolbox is used 
for model prediction. The SHAP 40.0 toolbox is used for feature 
selection, and the Optuna 2.10.0 framework is used to determine the 
optimum values for the model parameters which is shown in Table 2. 
We executed 10 splits of the data set using various random seeds in 
order to account for the small sample size of this study and the 
aforementioned randomisation. After doing so, we  averaged the 
results of all 10 experiments.
Before we  started the feature selection process, our dataset 
contained a total of 11 features. Using the Tree SHAP approach, 
you are able to determine the contribution value that corresponds to 
each feature that is contained inside the sample dataset. The ranking 
of the feature contributions is determined by using the average 
SHAP value for all of the samples. In accordance with the GBDT 
model, the contributions of the global features are depicted. The ST 
Slope and Chest Pain Type have a significant influence on the patient 
condition (CVD) in patients with cardiovascular disease. In order to 
cut the model operating time even more, some features that aren’t 
necessary will have to be eliminated. We chose to adopt a cutoff of 
0.02, which led to the elimination of the Resting ECG characteristic 
while permitting the retention of the other 10 features. We used the 
AUC to evaluate the performance both before and after the feature 
selection process. Even though the AUC values of GBDT went down, 
the drop wasnot substantial at all, and there was not any difference 
that could be  considered statistically significant by performing 
metrics such as AUC, Threshold, Sensitivity, Specificity which is 
shown in Figures 2–5.
The incidence of CVD was quite low in this experiment, 
resulting in poor PPV and NPV values for each of the seven 
different ML models. Because of this, their therapeutic value may 
suffer as a result of an increase in the number of false-positive 
results. The probabilities that were predicted by each machine 
learning model were unique, and the risk distribution for LR was 
comparable to that of SVM. Patients who had a CVD episode had 
estimated risks that were greater, across all ML models, than 
those patients who had not had a CVD episode. The plots also 
demonstrated that all ML models overestimated the risks of those 
individuals who had not experienced any CVD events. This 
finding suggests that this variable may also affect how well a 
model predicts what will happen.
It is necessary to have a risk model in order to determine 
whether individuals have a high probability of developing 
CVD. We intended to test seven machine learning (ML)-based 
models to evaluate how correctly they could predict the risk of 
CVD. The findings demonstrated that each one of them had good 
to excellent discrimination and that they were all accurately 
calibrated. When it came to forecasting the risk of CVD, penalised 
LR performed better than other machine learning models, just 
like SVM did. The specificity of the SVM was higher than that of 
the LR, while the LR had a lower level of sensitivity. It is possible 
that a higher level of specialisation was favoured in this Kazakh 
Chinese group because the majority of the population was 
nomadic and there were few medical services available. In 
addition to this, when taking calibration and DCA into 
consideration, SVM fared marginally better than LR. Because of 
this, SVM and LR can be used to find people in this group who 
are at a higher risk of CVD and to find out if putting risk-
mitigation interventions in place for these people will improve 
their CVD outcomes during the clinical decision-making process.
Linear regression has been widely used in the clinic to 
construct predictive models due to the ease with which it may 
be  interpreted and its general straightforwardness. In a study 
aimed at predicting myocardial ischemia, both LR and SVM were 
shown to have the same level of predictive ability, which was 
consistent with our findings. A recent and exhaustive study 
concluded that there is no performance benefit to be gained from 
using ML in clinical prediction models over using LR. It was 
determined that when machine learning algorithms were applied 
to small datasets with a limited number of predictors, LR models 
might perform better than ML models in terms of overall 
performance. It is possible that the small sample size and the L1 
penalised technique used in this work are to blame for the superior 
performance of LR in comparison to other machine learning 
models, with the exception of SVM.
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known supervised 
machine learning approach that has found applications in a wide 
variety of business sectors. The fundamental idea behind support 
vector machines (SVM) is to locate the hyperplane that has the

capacity to effectively classify the data while also providing the 
biggest geometric margin. In addition to this, it possesses significant 
kernel capabilities, which simplify the process of dealing with 
nonlinear classification issues. The outstanding performance of SVM 
demonstrates that it is a great tool for tackling classification challenges 
on small, non-linear, and high-dimensional datasets. This 
demonstrates that SVM is an excellent tool. In our experiment, 
we observed that the SVM performed significantly better than other 
machine learning models.
When it comes to classification, RF is among the most successful 
ensemble learning strategies that may be used. Its predictions were not 
nearly as accurate as those generated by the LR and SVM algorithms, 
which were the other two options. It is likely that the limited number 
of participants in this study will prevent RF from achieving its full 
potential as a prediction tool. The concept of variable importance was 
utilised in order to locate potential indicators of CVD. Some studies 
suggest that RF may be  capable of revealing crucial but 
undisclosed predictions.
According to the results of feature selection that was based on RF, 
the age of the patient was the most significant predictor in the 
classification of CVD. In this study, it was discovered that certain risk 
factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, were not as predictive as 
previously believed. Previous studies have shown that the synthetic 
indices BAI and LHR are both very good indicators of cardiovascular 
disease. Inflammation plays a significant part in the formation of 
atherosclerotic plaques as well as1 the progression of cardiovascular 
disease is shown in Figures 6–11.
There is evidence that inflammatory cytokines, such as high-
sensitivity CRP and interleukin-6, are associated with an elevated risk 
of cardiovascular disease. The Hs-CRP inflammatory marker was 
included in the Reynolds Risk Score in order to account for its role as 
a potential contributor to cardiovascular disease. hs-CRP has been 
shown in a number of other epidemiological studies to be  an 
important predictor of CVD. These studies have also shown that 
hs-CRP acts as a mediator in the pathogenesis of vascular disease and 
is a marker of endothelial dysfunction. These findings are consistent 
with the findings of the aforementioned studies. It was discovered that 
Hs-CRP increases the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture in

addition to destabilising atherosclerotic plaques via NO, IL-6, 
and prostacyclin.
In addition, hs-CRP has been demonstrated to enhance 
thrombosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to hypoxia, 
which provides more support for its position as a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease. It has been demonstrated that IL-6 is a 
factor in the course of atherosclerosis and that it promotes the 
creation of atherosclerotic plaques. This factor may have contributed 
to the increase in the number of cases of CVD. Taking statins, 
which can reduce a person chance of acquiring CVD, is beneficial 
for a great number of people and can help them avoid developing 
the condition. In clinical practise, Hs-CRP and IL-6 can be used as 
biomarkers for the early diagnosis of patients who have an increased 
likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease.
According to the findings of our study, a decrease in ADP was 
associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease. The adipose hormone ADP, which is secreted by adipocytes, 
has anti-inflammatory effects. These effects manifest themselves as 
a reduction in the levels of CRP and lymphocyte recruitment in 
atherosclerotic lesions, a reduction in the expression of TNF-, and 
an increase in the production of cytokines that are protective 
against inflammation. On the other hand, there is evidence from a 
small number of studies that suggests an increase in ADP may assist 
in avoiding an ischemic stroke. Increased NEFA concentrations 
have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease in previous research, and our study came to the same 
conclusion. The possible effects of NEFA on cardiovascular disease 
include the potential to exacerbate or worsen a number of illnesses, 
including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, 
and endothelial deterioration, to name a few. Patients can have a 
lower chance of developing cardiovascular disease if they are treated 
to have a lower ADP (CVD).
The risk prediction models that are currently being used in 
CVD domains were built using traditional statistical methodologies, 
as many studies have revealed. Nevertheless, these models have 
been proven to be erroneous in external populations. In the field of 
cardiology, machine learning algorithms have proven to be superior 
methods for deriving predictions from big datasets that are 
notoriously difficult to understand. No prior assumptions are made 
by machine learning algorithms, which means that any data can 
be used to develop accurate and resilient models. Because of this, 
ML is able to model more complex relationships between outcomes 
and predictors, which are typically more challenging to express 
using standard statistical methods. Discovering interactions 
between marginal predictors can help improve risk-management 
strategies when using ML.
Machine learning has the potential to identify new genotypes 
and phenotypes for a variety of CVDs, as well as novel risk factors 
for CVDs. All aspects of medical picture recognition, diagnosis, 
outcome prediction, and prognosis evaluation can be improved 
with the application of more sophisticated machine learning 
techniques such as deep learning and artificial neural networks 
(ANN). It possible that in the future, cardiologists will make 
better clinical decisions if they use machine learning models 
rather than the CVD risk stratifications that are currently used. 
On the other hand, most ML models may be hard for medical 
professionals to understand and use, which may limit how often 
they can be used in clinical settings.
5. Conclusion
According to the findings of this research, a stacking fusion 
model-based classifier performs better than individual models on all 
assessment criteria. This finding suggests that stacking models can 
combine the benefits of a variety of model types to achieve superior 
prediction performance. The recommended stacking approach offers 
improved prediction performance, increased resilience, and increased 
utility for individuals who are at high risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease. Hospitals can utilise this information to 
identify patients who are at a high risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease and provide them with early clinical intervention in order to 
reduce that risk. Research in the field of deep learning will benefit 
from additional data from a large number of medical institutions, 
which may be used for the development of artificial neural network 
structures or for the usage of deep learning frameworks in the future. 
In future work, the other deep learning techniques algorithms can 
be incorporated into Internet of Things (IoT) environments which 
helps to achieve more accuracy in terms of result and it can be useful 
to the hospitals and saving several human life.
